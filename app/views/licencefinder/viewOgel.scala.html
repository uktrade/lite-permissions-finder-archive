    Dear exporter
  </p>

  <p class="bold">
    Our Ref: @licenceInfo.getLicenceNumber
  </p>

  <p>
    Based on the choices you made on the Export Control Joint Unit online tool, you have registered to use the
    following Open General Licence (OGEL) which may only be used at the sites listed here:
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="bold">Licence number:</span> @licenceInfo.getLicenceNumber
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="bold">OGEL type:</span> Open General Export Licence (@licenceInfo.getLicenceType)
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="bold">Site:</span> @licenceInfo.getSiteAddress
  </p>

  <p>
    Please note you will not receive a hardcopy licence from the Export Control Organisation (ECO) but you can download
    and print the licence generated by the tool.
  </p>

  <p>
    You may now export goods and/or software/technology against this OGEL, provided that:
  </p>

  <ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>
      you have downloaded and read carefully, a copy of the relevant licence and all the terms and conditions set out
      within the licence, and have met these in full. See our website for
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/open-general-export-licences-ogels" target="_blank">all OGELs<span class="visually-hidden"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>
    </li>
    <li>
      your licence [reference] number or OGEL type (both listed above) must be referenced on supporting documentation
      accompanying the items you are exporting against this OGEL, and in the records you keep
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="heading-medium">Keep your business information up to date</h2>
  <p>
    You must update SPIRE if any of the business information you have registered on SPIRE changes.
  </p>

  <p>
    This means it's your responsibility to use SPIRE to:
  </p>

  <ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>
      upload new business information, such as business name, Companies House registration and VAT registration number
    </li>
    <li>
      register your OGEL under a new business or if your site changes
    </li>
    <li>
      de-register the OGEL under a previous business/sites
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You must upload your new business information onto SPIRE within 30 days of any changes to your business.
    <span class="bold">Failure to do this will make your licence void.</span>
  </p>

  <h2 class="heading-medium">How to stay compliant</h2>
  <p>
    You may find guidance on best practice for effective compliance procedures and advice on strategic export controls in our
    <a href="https://www.gov.uk//government/publications/compliance-code-of-practice" target="_blank">
      'Compliance Code of Practice' document<span class="visually-hidden"> (opens in a new tab)</span>
    </a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Compliance Inspectors may audit your records within 3-6 months of your registration to ensure your business
    complies with the terms and conditions of the licence you've used. You'll be notified if an inspection is required.

  </p>

  <h2 class="heading-medium">Restrictions not operated by the Export Control Organisation</h2>
  <p>
    Your application to register for an OGEL was not assessed against other restrictions on exports
    (for example on antique goods or pharmaceutical products) not administered by ECO. Learn more about these

  </p>

  <h2 class="heading-medium">Make sure your licence is current</h2>
  <p>
    OGELs are subject to change and you must ensure that the licence you're using is current. You can ask to receive
    <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/notices-to-exporters" target="_blank">
      email notifications of any amendments to OGELs<span class="visually-hidden"> (opens in a new tab)</span>
    </a>.
  </p>

  <h2 class="heading-medium">Where to find further information</h2>
  <p>
    It is the responsibility of exporters to consult the current export control legislation, familiarise themselves with
    export controls and make their own evaluation of the need for export licences.

    Although you have used the online tool to register to use the Open General Licence (OGEL) listed above, if you are
    still unsure whether your goods, software or technology require a licence, you can use the following online
    resources to double check. These tools will help you to 'self rate' and identify whether your goods are on the
    Control Lists.
  </p>

  <ol class="list list-number">
    <li>
      Control List Classification Service. This tool is only available on SPIRE and registration is required. It has
      been designed to help you search for previous 'Control List Classification/Rating' assessments made by the
      ECO's Technical Assessment unit.

        Control List Classification Service
      </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      The Goods Checker Database Tool. This tool has been designed to help you undertake key word searches on the
      specific wording included in the UK Strategic Export Control lists. This tool can help identify definitions as
      referenced in Control Lists.

  <h2 class="heading-medium">How to access training</h2>
  <p>
    You can receive training from the ECO if you're unsure whether your goods, software or technology require a licence.
    We run a number of training courses around the country and can also run courses for your business. A charge is
    applied for this service. Find out about

    You have not found your item in the UK Military List. This does not mean that your item is not controlled.

  <div class="banner danger-banner">
    <span class="visually-hidden">Warning:</span>
    Always double-check if your items are controlled. If you export controlled items without the correct export licence
    you could have your items seized, be fined and face up to 10 years in prison.

  <h2 class="heading-large">What you should do next</h2>

  <ol class="circle-step-list">
    <li>
      Get someone who knows the technical details of your details of your item to help you check the choices you've
      made against the technical specifications of your item.
    </li>
    <li>
      Go back to verify the type of item and which category it falls under within the UK Military List.
    </li>
    <li>
      Consider whether your item is specially designed for military use or not. If your item is not military than you
      should consider the dual use list.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 class="heading-large">Export control licenses</h2>

  <p>You cannot export items without a licence if:</p>

  <ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>you know or suspect they'll be used in a weapons of mass destruction programme or delivery system (also known
      as 'end-use controls')</li>
    <li>you're exporting dual-use items that do not usually need an export licence but you know or suspect they might
      be incorporated into military equipment for use in embargoed countries</li>
    <li>there are embargoes, sanctions or other restrictions which cover your export destination</li>
  </ul>

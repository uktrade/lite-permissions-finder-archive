<ol class="circle-step-list">
  <li>
    Get a technical expert who understands your item's design and technical specifications to check if your item:
    <ul class="list list-bullet text">
      <li>is specially designed or modified for a military application (also known as military use)</li>
      <li>is defined as a component, software or technology</li>
      <li>needs to be checked against another one of the UK Strategic Export Control Lists</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    If you don't have a technical expert to help you then read the following guidance on the GOV.UK website:

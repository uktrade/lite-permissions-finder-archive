<h1 class="heading-large">You are unlikely to need an import licence</h1>

<p>
  You do not need a licence to import the majority of goods from another EU country into the UK.
</p>
<p>
  You do need to follow special rules to move some types of item within the EU, for example plants or plant products
  that can host quarantine pests and diseases.
